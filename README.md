# tkinter-calculator

## I created a little calculator using Python GUI library - Tkinter

 * Every tile of the calculator and it's position is saved in settings.py file for easier management later on and expanding possibility.

 * Calculator is working for either dark or light mode depending on your PC settings.

 * Button classes set positions for each created tile and set calculating logic functions.

 * Each special button operation has it's own function, since the input and output varies. Each basic arithmethic button is packed into one function, since they're pretty simlar.

To get it work you have to get needed libraries, such as CustomTkinter, Darkdetect and Math
If you don't have these, simply download them using `pip install <library-name>` command.
